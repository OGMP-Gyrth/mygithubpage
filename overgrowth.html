		<h3>Overgrowth Mods</h3>
		<p>These are some of the mods that I made for Overgrowth. The game uses The Phoenix Engine, a custom engine made by <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/overgrowth">Wolfire Games</a>.</p>
		<p>The mods are written in AngelScript and <a href="https://github.com/Gyrth/OGMods">freely available</a> for anyone to use or modify under the GPL License.</p>

					<h3>Drika Hotspot</h3>
					<p>The biggest mod is Drika Hotspot (DHS). It is a visual scripting tool that allows players to setup interactive elements in their level without scripting knowledge.</p>
					<p>Features include a complete dialogue system, a UI system that supports text and images, a blender-like timeline animation system and much more. The project has been setup with modularity in mind. This allows new features to be implemented without breaking compatibility.</p>

					<h3>Bow and Arrow</h3>
					<p>One of my most popular mods. The bow and arrow with custom models, sounds and control script.</p>
					<p>Different arrow types have different effects like a stun, poison and exploding arrow. Complete with quiver which holds up to six arrows.</p>

					<h3>Multiplayer</h3>
					<p>A highly requested feature by the community was multiplayer. While the engine did not support networking at first, I managed to solve this by using the UI framework Awesomium to send and receive data via HTTP POST requests. </p>
					<p>The framework was later removed from the engine however the developers were kind enough to add TCP socket support. The client was made in AngelScript while the server was written in C++. This was a collaboration with Surak.</p>

					<h3>Grenade and Landmine</h3>
					<p>These two mods are very similar and one of the first mods I made. The grenade can be be picked up, sheathed and thrown. It works with a timer so once triggered it will explode no matter what. <a href="https://github.com/OGMP-Gyrth/OGMods/tree/grenade">Source</a></p>
					<p>The landmine works as a simple hotspot that triggers an explosion when a character enters. <a href="https://github.com/OGMP-Gyrth/OGMods/tree/landmine">Source</a></p>

					<h3>Big City</h3>
					<p>A map made to test the maximum size a level can be in the Phoenix Engine. A small amount of polygons and repeating textures makes it run as good as any other level. <a href="https://github.com/OGMP-Gyrth/OGMods/tree/big_city">Source</a></p>
